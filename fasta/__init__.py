"""A Python implementation of Goldstein et. al's Fast Adaptive Shrinkage/Thresholding Algorithm for convex optimization.

FASTA minimizes a function expressed in the form,

    min h(x) = f(Ax) + g(x),

where `f` is convex and differentiable and `g` is convex.
`g` may be non-differentiable, or possibly not even finite-valued, so normal gradient descent methods cannot be used.

The FASTA algorithm is a variant of the Forward-Backward Splitting (FBS) algorithm, which alternatively takes steps
to optimize `h` by optimizing `f` and then `g`. The optimization of `g` relies on the computation of the proximal
operator of `g` with stepsize `t`, equal to argmin { t*g(x) + .5 ||x-z||**2 }, which finds a point `x` close to the
minimum value of `g` while not straying too far from `z`.

The FASTA algorithm incorporates various improvements to FBS, as detailed in (Goldstein et al. 2016), including
adaptive stepsize selection, acceleration, non-monotone backtracking line search,
and a variety of stopping conditions. Additionally, included in this pacakage are eleven different example problems that
are solved using FASTA.
